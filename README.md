AVI is a longitudinal data collection app for children with Neurofibromatosis and their parents and guardians. AVI makes it easy and accessible to log symptoms, provide customized information for the caregivers, and encourage children to communicate their conditions openly and in an engaging way.

### Introduction
Neurofibromatosis manifests itself in many different symptoms, making it challenging to obtain longitudinal data of the development of potential symptoms through standard questionnaires. It also puts a significant burden on caregivers, parents, and guardians to look out for many possible complications without ways to selectively focus their attention when observing their child's symptoms. Moreover, because Neurofibromatosis is such a rare disease, children may find it difficult to openly communicate their conditions due to feeling isolated and different from their peers.

## Methods
We approached these problems with three goals in mind.
1. We want to help children with NF accept and be proud of who they are regardless of their medical condition
- We created AVI, a virtual pet for children with NF! Avi serves as a companion to help incentivize the child to communicate their feelings and symptoms. As kids log entries consistently, Avi grows and thrives. Avi will develop brighter fur, new facial expressions, and more animation. If the log is neglected, Avi decreases in size and vibrancy. It is the childâ€™s responsibility to care for Avi and, in turn, themselves! 

2. We want to streamline the process of logging symptoms and make it possible to collect a finer timeline of records to help the NF research community.
- We develop a one-point entry system where users can log their symptoms and experience as a text description (either by typing or speaking through speech recognition). This text log is then preprocessed and fed into the word embedding model and finds the list of symptoms that are most similar to the input text log. Target symptoms are 60+ symptoms identified in the [CTF NF Patient Registry Dataset](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22684314/wiki/605535). The identified symptoms are stored without user-identifying information in the database to be used for the research community.

2. We want to help caregivers to make more informed observations that can help them report symptoms to physicians and to recognize any development of complications.
- Our app computes the list of other potential complications (e.g. brain tumor, social or cognitive disorders) associated with the currently identified symptoms, using the phi-correlation between symptoms from the existing patient data from CTF NF Patient Registry Dataset. This information is available for caregivers, which caregivers can use as additional guidance to stay informed.
- Additionally, the users can add more in-depth log and pictures of skin lesions. When the user uploads a picture of a skin lesion, we classify the lesions using the image classification model to inform the user as well as to optimize the lesion image storage.
- When additional logs are made that confirm a diagnosis of a new condition or melanomas, we retrain our models based on this data.
